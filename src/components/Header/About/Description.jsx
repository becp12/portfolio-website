        I am an <span>integrious</span>, <span>empathetic</span>, <span>eager-to-learn</span> and <span>hard-working</span> Software Engineer.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In my previous career as a data entry clerk, I was required to have a <span>strong attention to detail</span>, ensuring the data was <span>clean</span> and <span>accurate</span> to ensure orders were completed as expected and in a <span>timely manner</span>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These skills will be extremely beneficial in my <span>Software Engineering</span> field as coding requires <span>attention to detail in all aspects</span> - spelling, syntax and general formatting.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <span>Iâ€™m looking to launch my career in tech.</span> I'd like to work in a role with an innovative team working to solve a multitude of different problems that will <span>make a difference in the world</span> and enjoy <span>working together</span> as a team.
